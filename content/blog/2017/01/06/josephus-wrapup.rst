This post is a reflection on the two problems (MAW 3.13 & 3.10) I
have been working on for the past five days.

*******************
Dynamic arrays in C
*******************

One of the ways I try out to solve `Josephus Problem <{filename}/blog/2016/12/31/josephus-problem.md>`_ is to use circular double linked list, which
is implemented in `ET circularDoubleLinkedListJosephus(ET N, ET M) <https://github.com/xxks-kkk/algo/blob/master/linkedList/josephus/circularLinkedList.c>`_,
Inside the function, here is what I try to do initially:

.. code-block:: c

    ET people[N] = {0}; 
    for (i = 0; i < N; i++) 
    { 
      people[i] = i + 1; 
    } 

I try to make an array of consecutive numbers based upon the input ``N``. However, this way doesn't work in C because compiler has no clue
the size of array during compilation phase. This is what people called dynamic array in C. The following two pages offer execellent explanations
to dynamic array specific and array in C in general:

- `Dynamic arrays in C <http://www.mathcs.emory.edu/~cheung/Courses/255/Syllabus/2-C-adv-data/dyn-array.html>`_
- `Arrays in C <https://www.cs.swarthmore.edu/~newhall/unixhelp/C_arrays.html>`_

Here is what I've done eventually:

.. code-block:: c

     people = calloc(N, sizeof(int));
   
     for ( i = 0; i < N; i++)
     {
       *(people + i) = i + 1;
     }

There is one thing to note about ``calloc``. It essentially the same as ``malloc`` in terms of allocating a chunk of
array. However, unlike ``malloc``, ``calloc`` will zero-initlize the chunk, which is quite useful when we work with
array of integers. In other words, ``people = malloc(N*sizeof(int));`` is perfectly fine in this case but ``calloc``
gives an advantage to have more control on array content, especially useful when we debug.

***********************
Circularly Linked Lists
***********************

In MAW, author is kind of in-rush when talks about this section. When comes to implementation, how we deal with header node
need to carefully think through. This is what stated in the book:

  A popular convention is to have the last cell keep a pointer back to the first. This can be done with or without
  a header (if the header is present, the last cell points to it) and can also be done with doubly linked lists (the
  first cell's previous pointer points to the last cell).

Here is my circularly double linked list in picture:

.. image:: /images/circularly-double-linked-list-dummy.PNG

In words, our dummy node's ``Next`` points to the the first data node and ``Prev`` points to the last data node.
With this setup, the head of the list can be accessed by ``dummy.Next`` and tail by ``dummy.Prev``. In addition,
there will never be ``NULL`` pointers in the data structure.

******************************
Initialize an array of structs
******************************

When implement the radix sort solution, I need to construct an array of buckets,
with each bucket is a single linked list with a dummy node. Here is what I do:

.. code-block:: c

    static List
    makeEmptyArrayOfNodes(numBuckets)
    {
      Pos Buckets = malloc(numBuckets * sizeof(struct Node));

      int k;
      for (k = 0; k < numBuckets; k++)
      {
        Buckets[k].Next = NULL;
      }

      return Buckets;
    }

Here are two points worth noting:

- ``Pos`` is ``struct Node*`` (can be checked by ``ptype`` in GDB) when we allocate
  an array of ``struct Node``.

- There is difference between ``->`` and ``.``. In K&R Page 131, it says that:

    If ``p`` is a **POINTER** to a structure, then ``p->member-of-structure``
    refers to the particular member.

  and ``.`` is used to directly access a structure member.
  In my case, since ``Buckets[k]`` with type ``struct Node``, then I need to use ``.``.
  However, if I want to use ``->``, I need to use ``(&Buckets[k])->Next``.

**************************
For loop instead of while
**************************

I try to experiment different trick when I work on my algo. Here is what I try: use ``for`` loop instead
of ``while``:

.. code-block:: c

    deleteNode(ET elem, List L)
    {
      Pos dummyL = L->Next;
      Pos dummyPrev = L;

      for(; dummyL != NULL; dummyPrev = dummyL, dummyL = dummyL->Next)
      {
        if (dummyL->Element == elem)
        {
          Pos tmp = dummyL;
          dummyPrev->Next = dummyL->Next;
          free(tmp);
          return;
        }
      }
    }

****************************************************************
Use system implementation if find, otherwise use my own version
****************************************************************

I'm trying to use ``fls`` inside `int cyclicShiftJosephus(int N, int M) <https://github.com/xxks-kkk/algo/blob/77a66a5e911252a93e44bfb6d9bc4c62d85cdffc/linkedList/josephus/nonLinkedListSol.c>`_,
which return the last (most significant) bit set in value and return the index of that bit.
However, not all system has ``fls`` shipped by default. So, I implement my own version. But, I would prefer
the program to use system version if it can find one. Otherwise, use mine.

One solution is to use ``#ifndef`` with the structure looks like

.. code-block:: c

    #ifndef fls
    int fls(int mask) { ... }
    #endi

Another solution is to use `weak symbol <https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Weak_symbol>`_. However, this solution may not be portable.
Then, it looks something like this

.. code-block:: c

     int  __attribute__((weak)) fls(int mask){ .. }

If system ``fls`` is defined as strong, my ``fls`` implementation will be overridden.
