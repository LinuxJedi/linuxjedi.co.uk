*************
Terminology
*************

Like "list" in Chapter 3, "Trees" is another type of abstraction.

**tree**, **root**, **edge**

We can define a tree recursively. A tree is a collection of nodes. The collection
can be empty; otherwise, a tree consists of a distinguish node *r*, called the 
*root*, and zero or more nonempty (sub)tress :math:`T_1`, :math:`T_2`, ..., :math:`T_k`,
each of whose roots are connected by a directed *edge* from *r*.

**child**, **parent**

The root of each subtree is said to be a *child* of *r*, and *r* is the *parent*
of each subtree root.

**leaves**

Nodes with no children are known as *leaves*.

**siblings**

Nodes with the same parent are *siblings*.

**path**

A *path* from node :math:`n_1` to :math:`n_k` is defined as a sequence of nodes
:math:`n_1`, :math:`n_2`, ..., :math:`n_k` such that :math:`n_i` is the parent of 
:math:`n_{i+1}` for :math:`1<= i < k`.

**length**

The *length* of this path is the number of edges on the path, namely :math:`k-1`.

.. note::

    - There is a path of length zero from every node to itself.
    - Notice that in a tree there is exactly one path from the root to each node.

**depth**

For any node :math:`n_i`, the *depth* of :math:`n_i`, is the length of the unique
path from the root to :math:`n_i`. 

**internal path length**

The sum of the depths of all nodes in a tree is known as the *internal path length*.

**height**

The *height* of :math:`n_i` is the length of the longest path from :math:`n_i` to
a leaf. 

**ancestor**, **descendant**

If there is a path from :math:`n_1` to :math:`n_2`, then :math:`n_1` is an *ancestor*
of :math:`n_2` and :math:`n_2` is a *descendant* of :math:`n_1`. If :math:`n_1 \neq n_2`,
then :math:`n_1` is a *proper ancestor* of :math:`n_2` and :math:`n_2` is a *proper descendant* of :math:`n_1`.

**internal node**

An *internal node*  is a node with at least one child. In other words, internal nodes are nodes other than leaves.

**degree**

The total number of children of a node is called as *degree* of that node. The highest
degree of a node among all the nodes in a tree is called as *degree of tree*.

**level**

The root node is said to be at *level 0* and the children of root node are at *level 1*
and the children of the nodes which are at *level 1* will be at *level 2* and so on ...
In other words, in a tree each step from top to bottom is called as a *level* and the *level*
count starts with '0' and incremented by one at each level (step).

****************
Some properties
****************

- A tree is a collection of N nodes, one of which is the root, and N-1 edges.
  (since each edge connects some node to its parent, and every node except 
  the root has one parent.)
- The root is at depth 0.
- All leaves are at height 0.
- The height of a tree is equal to the height of the root.
- The depth of a tree is equal to the depth of the deepest leaf; this is always
  equal to the height of the tree.

Example

Let's work through MAW 4.1, 4.2, and 4.3 to get the tree terminology clear.

- "A" is the *root*
- "G", "H", "I", "L", "M", "K" are the *leaves*
- "A":

  - *children*: "B", "C"
  - *depth*: 0
  - *height*: 4
- "B":

  - *parent*: "A"
  - *children*: "D", "E"
  - *siblings*: "C"
  - *depth*: 1
  - *height*: 3
- The depth of the tree is 4
