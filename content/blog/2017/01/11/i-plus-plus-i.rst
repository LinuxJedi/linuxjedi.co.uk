I'm starting to read through `Hacking: The Art of Exploitation <https://www.amazon.com/Hacking-Art-Exploitation-Jon-Erickson/dp/1593271441>`_ on
my four hours daily commute to work in order to get myself more comfortable working with C. I resolve a puzzle I have about C, as shown in the title.

- ``i++`` means increment the value of ``i`` by ``1`` *after* evaluating the arithmetic operation.

.. code-block:: c

     int a, b;
     a = 5;
     b = a++ * 6;

``b`` will contain ``30`` and ``a`` will contain ``6``, since the shorthand of ``b = a++ * 6``;
is the equivalent to the following statements:

.. code-block:: c

    b = a * 6;
    a = a + 1;

- ``++i`` means increment the value of ``i`` by ``1`` *before* evaluating the arithmetic operation.

.. code-block:: c

     int a, b;
     a = 5;
     b = ++a * 6;

``b`` will contain ``36`` and ``a`` wil contain ``6``, since the shorthand of ``b = ++a * 6``; is the
equivalent to the following statement:

.. code-block:: c

    a = a + 1;
    b = a * 6;
    
In fact, the two principles mentioned above apply more than "evaluating the arithmetic operation".
For example, in the stack ``push`` operation:

.. code-block:: c

     /* Push an element on the Stack
      */
     void
     push (ET elem, Stack S)
     {
       if (isFull(S))
       {
         resizeStack(S);
       }
       S->Array[++S->TopOfStack] = elem;
     }

we can do ``S->Array[++S->TopOfStack] = elem;``, which is equivalent with the following, a nice short verison:

.. code-block:: c

   S->Array[S->TopOfStack] = elem;
   S->TopOfStack = S->TopOfStack + 1;

Another example is stack ``topAndPop``:

.. code-block:: c

     /* Check the top element and pop it out of Stack
      */
     ET
     topAndPop(Stack S)
     {
       return S->Array[S->TopOfStack--];
     }
   
In this case, we essentially do:

.. code-block:: c

   ET a = S->Array[S->TopOfStack];
   S->TopOfStack = S->TopOfStack - 1;
   return a;

Look how clean I can make my code is if I can understand the difference between ``++i`` and ``i++``.

``++i`` and ``i++`` is really a powerful technique to shorten the C code. However, it can be error-prune
if the user is not careful enough.

Let's take a look at the following code snippet, which is adapted from the program on K & R p.117.

.. code-block:: c

    main(int argc, char* argv[])
    {
      while (--argc > 0 && (*++argv)[0] == '-')
        while (c = *++argv[0])
          switch (c)
          {
            case 'x':
              printf ("user invokes the program with -x option\n");
              break;
            case 'n':
              printf ("user invokes the program with -n option\n");
              break;
            default:
              printf("illegal option %c\n", c);
              argc = 0;
              break;
          }
       if (argc != 1)
         printf("Usage: find -x pattern\n");
    }

This program itself is straightforward. Let's take a look at ``(*++argv)[0]`` to see what it means.
Since ``argv`` is a pointer to the beginning of the array of argument strings, incrementing it by
``1`` (i.e. ``++argv``) makes it point at the original ``argv[1]`` instead of ``argv[0]``. Then we
dereference it to get the value of the argument string that we are currently looking at (i.e
``*++argv``). Now, we get its first character by adding ``[0]``. So, we have ``(*++argv)[0]``.
For example, we run our program with ``a.out -x -n pattern``. Then our ``argv`` looks like
``{"-x", "-n", "pattern"}``. Then ``argv[0]`` is ``"-x"``, ``argv[1]`` is ``"-n"``, and so on.

The reason we need parenthesis in ``(*++argv)[0]`` can be seen in the next line ``c = *++argv[0]``.
Since ``[]`` binds tighter than ``*`` and ``++``, then ``*++argv[0]`` is equivalent with
``c = *++(argv[0])``. ``argv[0]`` points to the first char of the argument string that ``argv`` pointing
at. Then we increment and dereference ``argv[0]`` to get the next character in the argument string.
For instance, suppose ``argv`` pointing at ``-x``. Then ``argv[0]`` pointing at ``-`` and we increment and
dereference ``argv[0]`` to get ``x`` and assign to ``c``.

We can see that the level of precedence of operators is crtical in this case. This can be seen from table on
p.53. in K & R:

.. image:: /images/precedence-operators-c.PNG

Let's see another example from K & R p. 105.

.. code-block:: c

    void strcpy(char *s, char *t)
    {
      while ((*s++ = *t++) != '\0')
        ;
    }

In this case, the value of ``*t++`` is the character that ``t`` pointed to before ``t`` was incremented; the
postfix ``++`` doesn't change ``t`` until after this character has been fetched. This makes sense if we
consider it from precedence of the operators' view. ``*`` and ``++`` has the same precedence in our table. Thus,
we evaluate the expression in ordinary order: from left to right. We first evaluate ``*s`` then we increment ``s``.
