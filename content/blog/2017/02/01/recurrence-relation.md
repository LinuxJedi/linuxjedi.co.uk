Able to solve recurrence relation is a very important skill when we study data structures
and algorithm. This is a ability that I used to be familar with when I took combinatorics
class when I was an undergraduate. However, by that time, I didn't realize how important 
this skill is from computer science point of view. But, thanks to MAW, I do now.

This post is a study summary note on this very important subject. The aim of this note 
is to help at least me quickly solve any types of recurrence relation in the future.
The content closely follows Chapter 7
"Recurrence Relations and Generating Functions" of 
["Introductory Combinatorics"](https://www.amazon.com/Introductory-Combinatorics-5th-Richard-Brualdi/dp/0136020402),
which is the textbook I used when I took combinatorics class.
