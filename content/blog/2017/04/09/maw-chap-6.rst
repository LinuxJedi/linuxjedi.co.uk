In chapter 6, we learn about the priority queue ADT. We assume each item has 
a "priority" and the ADT allows us to insert the element into the queue and 
get the element with "highest" priority from the queue. The model looks like

.. raw:: html

and the big picture we have studied so far becomes:

.. raw:: html

    <img src="/images/ADT.PNG" alt="ADT overview"/>

In order to support two operations required by the model, we propose four new 
implmentations. `Binary heap <{filename}/blog/2017/03/31/binary-heap.md>`_ is 
the most commonly-seen one. Insert can be done in :math:`O(\log N)` in the worst
case and constant on average. DeleteMin can be done in :math:`O(\log N)`. However,
it has natural drawback in supporting merge operation, which is needed when we 
want to merge two heaps into one. This needs to the 
`leftist heap <{filename>/blog/2017/04/03/leftist-heaps.md>`_, 
`skew heap <{filename>/blog/2017/04/04/skew-heap.md>`_, and 
`binomial-queue <{filename>/blog/2017/04/08/binomial-queue.md>`_. leftist heap
supports all three operations (insert, DeleteMin, merge) efficiently but we
needs to maintain extra information in the node and we need to do extra test 
when working with leftist heap in order to maintain the leftist heap property. 
To better solve these two little disadvantages, we propose skew heap, which has 
no restriction on the tree structure at all while maintain the efficiency of operations
in amortized time. However, we are still unsatisfy with the structure because
both leftist heap and skew heap cannot support constant on average insertion like
binary heap does. This is why we propose a new structure called binomial heap.

Applications of priority queue is enormous:

- Operating system task scheduler
- Forward network packets in order of urgency
- Select most frequent symbols for data compression
- Sorting
- Implementation for greedy algorithms
