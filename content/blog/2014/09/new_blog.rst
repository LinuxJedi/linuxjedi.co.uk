Blogger is a great blogging platform.  Unfortunately it is really difficut to create content that has marked-up code in it.  Which as a developer is a requirement.  Therefore LinuxJedi's /dev/null has now moved to this GitHub pages site using `Tinkerer <http://tinkerer.me/>`_ to build it.

The old site and content can still be accessed at `<http://thelinuxjedi.blogspot.com/>`_.
