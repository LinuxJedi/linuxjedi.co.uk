My name is Ze-Yuan Hu (you can call me "Z", which is given by one of my math professor at college). 
My day job is as a Software Engineer at IBM working on `Federation Server <http://www-03.ibm.com/software/products/en/ibminfofedeserv>`_, which shipped with `DB2 <http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/db2/>`_, `dashDB <http://www.ibm.com/analytics/us/en/technology/cloud-data-services/dashdb/>`_, `BigSQL <https://www-01.ibm.com/software/data/infosphere/hadoop/big-sql.html>`_ , and many other IBM data warehouse solutions.
