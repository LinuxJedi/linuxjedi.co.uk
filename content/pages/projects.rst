Libra
-----

Libra was the original Load Balancer as a Service for HP Helion.  I was the lead developer for the project.  It created many new things that other OpenStack projects are starting to embrace such as self-healing and warm-appliance pools.

Drizzle
-------

Drizzle started as a fork of MySQL 6.0 alpha with much of the code re-written to be cleaner and with a micro-kernel architecture.  I was a core developer of the project.
